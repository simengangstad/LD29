## Beneath the surface

- Something beneath the ground in earth terms
    - Maybe some cave/dungeon type style.

- Beneath the surface of the ocean
    - Submarines?

- The idea that there is so much more under the surface
    - Much more fun?

- A kind of Inception-like world where things go slower the further down you go.
    - Each stage has different time (the slower the further you go down).
    - You can go up and down anytime.
    - The current stage is the one which is lit.
    - The goal is to go down (and bring something up?) in the shortest time available?

- Some colony has discovered a fantastic planet to live on
    - End up on the planet beneath the surface
        - Planet is very valuable because of it's unique pulsar core
        - At the end the player sees the surface which is completely abandoned/dead because the supercharge of the teleporter
          that takes power from the center or the fighting?
            - Don't judge someone from their surface, they might be a shining star beneath the surface.
            - Some people need fuel and some take their fuel?
            - You've destroyed the planet.
        - Goal to get to the center of the planet for then supercharging the teleporter and go to the surface.
        - Map
            - Lots of lights?
            - Lot of colors under the surface and completely black/white on the surface.
            - For each stage down it gets harder and harder.
                - There is creatures living on the planet.
                    - They try to stop you and there is more and more of them as you go further down.
        - Tools
            - You got a generator and a battery
                - It is the source of power for the gun and the jetpack
                - If you run out of power you'll have to wait until it regains the power.
            - Some sort of gun to fight the enemies?
                - Pulsar?
                - Kinda fights the harmony of the game.
                    - Or does it? What if the fight is the reason the planet dies?
            - Some sort of invisibility suit that gain power from minerals you find in each stage?
                - This could be kinda easy though.
            - Jetpack?
        - Game play
            - You dig the ground and manage to avoid or blast the enemies until you get down.
            - Highest score based on how many enemies you blast.
